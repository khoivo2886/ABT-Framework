## <a id="application"></a>1. Application
A simple native Android application that shows a list of cities which user can search to view location of city on maps
### Features
- Support a thoundsand of cities.
- Support auto-complete when user input city name.
- Display location of selected city

## <a id="framework"></a>2. Action Based Testing Framework
Action Based Testing Framework (ABTF) allows automating End-to-End UI test via `Espresso` lib. `Kotlin` is language being used in framework to write test script.


### <a id="description"></a>Description

- This framework is using **Action Based Testing method (ABTM)** which represents the continued evolution of the keyword driven testing approach, which uses keywords to create and automate the majority of tests.
- ABT provides a powerful framework for organizing test design, automation and execution around keywords. In ABT, keywords are called **actions**-to make the concept absolutely clear. Actions are the tasks that are executed during a test. Rather than automating an entire test as one long script, tests are assembled using individual actions. Non-technical test engineers and business analysts can then define their tests as a series of these automated actions.
- ABT test case takes place in a class called as test class. Actions, test data, and any necessary GUI interface information are stored separately and referenced by the main test class.

## <a id="test-design"></a>3. Test Case Design
Test case design refers to **how you set-up your test cases**. It is important that your tests are designed well, or you could fail to identify bugs and defects in your software during testing.

## <a id="test-report"></a>4. Test Report

Test Report is a document which contains a summary of all test activities and final test results of a testing project. Test report is an assessment of how well the Testing is performed. Based on the test report, stakeholders can evaluate the quality of the tested product and make a decision on the software release.
